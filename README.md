## Usage üöÄ
Once installed, you can start using TidyTask directly from your terminal.

<br>

#### Add

To add a task run:
```
tidytask add "First Task"
```

Tasks can be given a due date using --due:
```
tidytask add "Finish Homework" --due 2025-06-01
```

Tasks can also be marked as high priority using --priority:
```
tidytask add "Submit Essay" --due 2025-06-25 --priority
```

<br>

#### List

To view your to-do list use:
```
tidytask list
```

You can use flags to just view certain types of task:
```
tidytask list --priority
```

<br>

#### Complete/Remove/Reopen

These commands are formatted the same way the same way.
- `complete` ‚Üí Marks a task as complete
- `remove` ‚Üí Removes a task from to-do list
- `reopen` ‚Üí Marks completed tasks as incomplete

<br>

To complete task numbers 1, 2 and 3:
```
tidytask complete 1 2 3
```

These commands support batch operations through the --all flag:
```
tidytask remove --all
```

The --all flag can be used with constrictions to target specific types of task
```
tidytask reopen --all --priority
```

<br>

### Search
The search command displays all tasks that match a certain keyword. By default, it searches all fields.
```
tidytask search "homework"
```

You can specify with flags which fields to search. For example, this is a search for tasks with the number 2025 in their due date:
```
tidytask search 2025 --due
```

Like with list, you can use flags just view certain types of task. For example, this is a search for all priority tasks with essay in the title:
```
tidytask search essay --title --complete
```

<br>

#### Undo

To reverse the previous action, run:
```
tidytask undo
```

#### Help
You can view all commands and general information, use:
```
tidytask --help
```
To view the help page for a specific command use:
```
tidytask [command] --help
```

## Support ‚ù§Ô∏è
TidyTask may be a simple tool but I've put a lot of time and love into building it, if you find it helpful I'm so glad!

I‚Äôm a student building free and open source tools for fun. If you would like to support my work, you can do so on Ko-Fi. 

There is absolutely no pressure or obligation, your kind words mean just as much to me.  <3
