# TidyTask

**TidyTask** is a simple Linux CLI tool for managing your to-do list, built with Go.

I'm developing this in my free time, so thereâ€™s currently no fixed timeline for completion.
Feedback is welcome!

## Planned Features
- Add, complete, and remove tasks
- View your upcoming tasks at a glance
- List and sort tasks based on various parameters
- Mark tasks as high priority
